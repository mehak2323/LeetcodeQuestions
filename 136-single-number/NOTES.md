- **METHOD 1 : USING MAPS (NOT USING CONSTANT SPACE )**

The question states that we have to find an element in the array with frequency=1.
So , the first idea that pops in the mind is to store the frequency of each element in a map (or a frequency array) and then traverse that map/array and return the element with frequency=1.

Map the given array's elements to their frequency. ( KEY : ELEMENT , VALUE : FREQUENCY ). Traverse that map and return the key whose value =1.

CODE :
```
class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) { 
       unordered_map<int,int> a;
	   for(auto x: nums)
		   a[x]++;
	   for(auto z:a)
		   if(z.second==1)
			   return z.first;
	   return -1;
    }
};
```
TC: O(N), SC: O(N)


Now , if we see the above method uses variable extra space, which is why it can't be our answer.
(Although it is an approach to solve this problem).
Then how do we solve this ??
Imagine you have blocks with the array elements inscribed on them. Now , if I sort the array for you and now ask you to find the element , CAN YOU DO SO ??

Yes , upon sorting , every element will have a similar element adjacent to it , if it has the frequency of 2.

- **METHOD 2 : USING SORTING (USING CONSTANT SPACE )**

As explained above , we do the following :

1. Sort the array.
2. Traverse the array and check if one of the adjacent elements is equal to the current element or not.
3. If yes , move ahead. Else return the current element.

CODE :
```
class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) { 
       sort(nums.begin(),nums.end());
        for(int i=1;i<nums.size();i+=2)
        {
            if(nums[i]!=nums[i-1])
                return nums[i-1];
        }
        return nums[nums.size()-1];
    }
};
```
TC: O(NlogN), SC: O(1)

The above approach can be used to solve the problem . But what if we can improve the time complexity ?? What if we dont have to sort the array ??
The following method deals with that approach.

- **METHOD 3 : USING BITWISE XOR OPERATOR (USING CONSTANT SPACE )**

To use this approach you first need to understand about Bitwise XOR operator.
Most of us who have a background in physics ( highschool level ) , are aware of the LOGIC GATES.
One of such gates is the XOR Gate :
According to this gate , the output is true , only if both the inputs are of opposite kind .
That is ,

A B Y /
0 0 0 /
0 1 1 /
1 0 1 /
1 1 0 

We apply the extended version of this gate in our bitwise XOR operator.
If we do "a^b" , it means that we are applying the XOR gate on the 2 numbers in a bitwise fashion ( on each of the corresponding bits of the numbers).
Similarly , if we observe ,
```
Some property of xor-

1) xor of a same number with itself is zero, i.e A ^ A = 0
2) xor is commutative that means a ^ b = b ^ a.
3) xor of any number with zero is the number itself i.e A ^ 0 = A.

4) A^B^A=B
5) (A^A^B) = (B^A^A) = (A^B^A) = B , This shows that position doesn't matter.
6) Similarly , if we see , a^a^a......... (even times)=0 and a^a^a........(odd times)=a

Suppose our array is arr[]: [5, 1, 3, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 4]
we will rearrange the array, and take all the numbers together, then our array looks like
                     arr[]: [1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7]
					 now, take xor of all numbers -
					 1 ^ 1 ^ 3 ^ 3 ^ 4 ^ 4 ^ 5 ^ 5 ^ 7   (rearrange the array)
					   0   ^   0   ^   0   ^   0   ^ 7   (see point number 1)
					               7                     (see point number 3) 
```

We apply the above observations :

1. Traverse the array and take the Bitwise XOR of each element.
2. Return the value.
3. Why does this work ??
4. Because , the elements with frequency=2 will result in 0. And then the only element with frequency=1 will generate the answer.

CODE :
```
class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) { 
       int ans=0;
	   for(auto x:nums)
	   ans^=x;
	   return ans;
    }
};
```
TC: O(N), SC: O(1)

- **METHOD 4: SUM OF ELEMENTS**
All the unique elements , in the array have a frequency of 2 , except one element.

1. Store all the unique elements in set.
2. Add the elements of the set and multiply by 2 (SUM_1).
3. Add all the elements of the array(ARRAY_SUM).
4. Return (SUM_1 - ARRAY_SUM) .

Why does this work ?? /
ARRAY_SUM = 2*(a1+a2+a3...+ak) + a(k+1) /
SUM_1 = 2*(a1+a2+a3+....+ak+ a(k+1))

a(x) represents the xth unique element in the array.
a(k+1) represents the element with frequency=1.
